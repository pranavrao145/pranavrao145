### Hi, I'm Pranav 👋

I'm an incoming University of Toronto CS student from Toronto, Ontario 🇨🇦. I'm interested in full stack app development, cybersecurity, and the improving the developer experience. In the future, I'd like to learn Rust, more DevOps tools, as well as more about ML/AI.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a core maintainer on [refactoring.nvim](https://github.com/thePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim), as well as on my latest project, [LANChat](https://github.com/pranavrao145/lanchat). 
- 🗃️ I've also worked on various other projects in the past, such as [Fulcrum](https://github.com/pranavrao145/fulcrum-mk2) and [Book Club](https://github.com/pranavrao145/book-club). See my [repositories tab](https://github.com/pranavrao145?tab=repositories) for a full list!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, React, and the WebSocket protocol. See my adventures in exploring these technologies in my newest work-in-progress project, [LANChat](https://github.com/pranavrao145/lanchat). I am also learning more about DevOps tools such as Hashicorp's Packer and Terraform.
- 💬 Ask me about Linux, Neovim, and the [refactoring project](https://github.com/thePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim). Take a look at my [dotfiles](https://pranavrao145/dotfiles)!
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way is through the contact form at the bottom of my [personal website](https://pranavrao-personal-website.herokuapp.com/).
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning new languages (not just programming languages, but real ones as well). I'm currently teaching myself Spanish!
